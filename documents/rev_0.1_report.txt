Evaluation Report for Revision 0.1
----------------------------------

PCB layout issues:

1) Via in pad of R103
2) Amp U402 footprint is rotated 180deg
3) Multiple unconnected gnd vias near J401

Schematic issues:

1) Missing 50ohm load across output of SAW U405
2) R305 prevents BBB from booting - remove to allow FPGA pins to float.
3) Capacitors C403, C404, C410, C411, C412 should all be 10pf to reduce low
   frequency gain of RF path.
4) R402, R403 not needed - replace with trace from U401-11 to U401-12
5) Q201, R201, R202, C213 not needed
6) Break out U202-1 to jumper for testing.
7) Add optional 3-pin header (GND, log video, +5V) for off-board TRF input
   to ADC.

System Issues:

1) Heavy interference from BBB HDMI - must be disabled in kernal args.
2) Strong 25kHz interference - still hunting for source
3) Strong 20MHz interference - appears to come from on-board oscillator.
   May not be an issue since it's synchronous to ADC sampling, but does
   bear further investigation.
